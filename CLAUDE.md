name: File placement conventions
description: Where new code must live — enforced by the user
type: feedback

---

All code must go in these directories, no exceptions:

- `@/constants` — static constants and config values
- `@/types` — TypeScript types and interfaces
- `@/hooks` — React hooks and client-side business logic
- `@/lib` — server-side helper functions
- `@/utils` — helper functions
- `@/components/layout` — page-level layout sections
- `@/components/ui` — reusable UI components

**Why:** The user explicitly set this up and expects it to be followed without being reminded.

**How to apply:** Before creating any new file, pick the correct directory from this list. Never create files outside these paths (plus `app/` for routes/pages and `schemas/` for zod schemas, `prisma/` for DB schema). Do not drop files in the root.

name: Code review pattern
description: How the user wants code reviews structured — tech-lead persona, six axes, scored issues
type: feedback

---

When the user asks for a code review, act as a super-duper smart tech lead and evaluate across these six axes:

- Performance
- Security
- Optimisation
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Reusability

At the end, list the issues found and score each from 0 to 10.

**Why:** User wants consistent, high-signal reviews framed by an experienced tech-lead lens, with quantified severity so they can triage fast.

**How to apply:** Use this format whenever the user says "review", "code review", or asks for an assessment of a file/PR/change. Walk through each axis, surface concrete issues (not generic advice), then end with an overall score for each area.

name: Never use em dash character
description: User dislikes the em dash (—). Never use it in code, copy, comments, or chat output.
type: feedback

---

Never use the em dash character `—` (U+2014). This applies to:

- Code (string literals, JSX text)
- Copy in constants/content files
- Comments
- Commit messages
- Chat responses to the user

**Why:** Direct user instruction in 2026-04 audit pass: "remove this character — never use it again."

**How to apply:** Use commas, periods, colons, parentheses, or hyphens (`-`) instead. When rephrasing, prefer the punctuation that fits the clause relationship:

- Aside / parenthetical → commas or parens: `X, which is Y,` or `X (Y)`
- Sharp break / amplification → period or colon: `X. Y` or `X: Y`
- Range / compound modifier → hyphen: `2015-2020`, `world-class`

The en dash (`–`, U+2013) is also off the table by extension — same character family, same vibe the user is rejecting.
